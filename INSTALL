Installing Boots Puzzle

You should be running GNU/Linux on an i486.
I have tested this on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), but it might work otherwise.

* Install required gems

** Install the rubygem application :

 sudo apt-get install rubygems

** Install the required gems

 sudo gem install rake mocha facets gosu

If gosu ask you for a version, you want to choose a version for ruby.

* Running

This should launch the demo :

 rake play adventure=demo

This should give more info :

 rake help
