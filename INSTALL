Installing Boots Puzzle

You should be running GNU/Linux on an i486.
I have tested this on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), but it might work otherwise.

There are a couple of dependencies to be able to run and or install the game.
How you install those dependencies will depend on your system.

- Dependencies

** Ruby 1.8
** Rake (I used 0.8.1)
** SDL and its ruby bindings (I used SDL 1.2 and libsdl-ruby1.1.0-2)
** Mocha (a ruby lib for mocking) to run the unit tests
** Shoes (a ruby GUI toolkit) for the editor

- Ubuntu

If you're here, that's because you are using the sources, but you might probably be better off with the debian package of boots-puzzle. You can get information on the home page of boots-puzzle (http://ph.on.things.free.fr/projects/boots-puzzle/index.html). It is normally a matter of adding a few lines to your apt source file, and then

 sudo apt-get install boots-puzzle.

There is no script to go 'easily' from the sources and install them on your machine, yet. No 'rake install' magic, sorry. But that will come, hopefully.

You can launch the game from the sources, of course, provided you get the dependencies. On an Ubuntu machine (so probably on Debian), you can get away with 'apt' :

 sudo apt-get install ruby rake libsdl-ruby1.8 libmocha-ruby1.8

However you need to get and install shoes from http://shoooes.net/

- Other platforms

I haven't tested it anywhere else, sorry. If you successfully install it on another system, drop a note !!

- Running

Once everything is installed, typing

 rake version

in the top level folder of the sources (that is, next to the Rakefile) should display the version number, something like

 Boots Puzzle vx.y.z - Copyright (C) 2008 Pierre-Henri Trivier

Then typing

 rake help
