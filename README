This is BootsPuzzle, an extensible puzzle game based on movement.

This is still a work in LOT of progress... so don't expect much.

See 'rake help' for info on how to play or run the editor.

Every commands should be run from above 'src' (that's where you are right now)

The hopefully-up-to-date release note in is org/puzzle.org. You should
open it with emacs org-mode to get something nice.

You should use emacs, because, well, you should.

Documentation will come (it should be somewhere in the todo list.)

Bug reports, suggestions, cialis adds, etc .. can be sent at phtrivier
AT yahoo DOT fr.
