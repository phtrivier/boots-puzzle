Puzzle (working title)

 a game where you have to go through mazes (how original).
 The trick is that depending on your shoes, you can do many funny stuff.
 The goal is to make thinks extendible (to use some metaprog magic)

 step 1 :

      A puzzle is a room, with a entry, an exit, a dimension, and cells (how original)
      A cell is an object, cause I want funny inheritence (and I should be able to ask cells stuff like : CAN I walk there ?)
      I want to load a puzzle from a description

class SillyPuzzle < Puzzle

 # w, h
 dim 4,3

 # row alias r
 # I is entry, - is walkable, # is wall, O is exit, but then it is just parsing
 row "I###"
 row "-###"
 row "---O"

end

  step 2 :

   a player is somthing that can walk on a puzzle, and be at a certain place
   it starts at the entry -> you know where the entry is ...

    it can try and walk on a puzzle, that is , it tries to go somewhere else, ask the puzzle if it is ok (puzzle.walkable?(i,j)) and then goes there

   if it reaches the end of the puzzle( oh, I don't know where the out is .... :D), then the puzzle is solved (puzzle.in?(i,j) / puzzle.out?(i,j))


  next step :
       * fixe the controls, if necerray

       * add the notion of getting to the out and be really happy (easy)

       * add the shoes

         the player has a current pair of shoes
             OK
         by default its the BareFeet
            OK
         moving the player actually asks its current shoes to move it
                OK

                the player can handles shoes in funny way :

                    * take_current_shoes_off
                                             (and then it has bare foot)
                    * puts_on shoes from its right hand
                              * if the player is already wearing shoes, it gets exchanged (that's easy to do, so no fun)
                    * puts_on shoes from its left hand

                    * drop shoes from its left hand / right hand

                    So you can wear at must one out of three shoes ...





       * make the editor, to be able to create decent levels (using Shoes !!)
