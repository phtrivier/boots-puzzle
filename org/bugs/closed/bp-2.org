* How ?
Create an adventure with no levels in the yaml file, and no 'levels' folder.
Open the editor.
* Seen ?
Popup appears to ask for the level's name and size.
Then the editor stays blank.
Shoes console indicates that there is no 'levels' folder (which makes sense, since the folder was not created).
* Expected ?
The folder should be created silently.
If the folder can't be created, crash with an error.
* Comments ?
