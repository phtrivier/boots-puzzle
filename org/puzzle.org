** DONE Cut down images for every kind of cells
*** DONE in
*** DONE out
*** DONE walkable
*** DONE wall
** DONE Add an image source to cells, and put images somewhere they can be loaded
   If nothing is said, the image is look for in a file that has the name of the class with lower case(no caml case for the moment)
** DONE In the puzzle application, load the images instead of drawing a rectangle
** TODO Add the 'walk' function (it does something when you walk on a Cell)
** TODO Add the story system
   When you load a puzzle, you can optionnaly
   - require a 'some_puzzle_name_story' module
   - call a load_story function, defined in the module
   - the function makes (for the moment), several calls to

     special_cell(:toto, Walkable) do
       foo bar baz
     end

   - it is possible to retrieve a cell by its name (so that cells can use each other)
** TODO Add quotes / dialogs / other persons ?
