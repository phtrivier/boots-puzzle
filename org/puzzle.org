* Puzzle Editor
** DONE [#A] Factor the code that loads / save the adventure / level out of the editor's GUI
** TODO [#B] Use a file loader to load the adventure / and or the level
(should be possible, if you select a level, you load the adventure, and that's all)
*** TODO Ask if you want to open an existing level or create a new one
*** TODO If they want to open an existing level 
**** TODO use ask_open_file to open an level file (default to the content of the "adventure" folder)
**** TODO use the result to guess the name of the adventure (that's one or two folders on the top) 
**** and where adventure should be loaded from (basically, that's the parent folder !!)
**** TODO use the name of the file, and the name of the adventure, and the prefixes, to load everything (note that it all comes
**** down to configuring the adventure_loader !!
*** TODO If they want to create a level
**** TODO use ask_open_dir to open an adventure folder (default to the content of the "adventure" folder)
**** TODO use the result to guess the name and location of the adventure
**** TODO Ask the name and dimensions of the new level

** TODO Implement "brushes" (select several cells by dragging a rectangle)
*** Note : you can change the "transparent.png" to something like a "selected.png", slighly less transparent, when doing so ?
** TODO Implement "drag / dropping" ?
