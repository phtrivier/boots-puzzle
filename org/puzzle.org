** DONE Cut down images for every kind of cells
*** DONE in
*** DONE out
*** DONE walkable
*** DONE wall
** DONE Add an image source to cells, and put images somewhere they can be loaded
   If nothing is said, the image is look for in a file that has the name of the class with lower case(no caml case for the moment)
** DONE In the puzzle application, load the images instead of drawing a rectangle
** DONE Add the 'walk' function (it does something when you walk on a Cell)
** DONE Add the story system
*** DONE Puzzle has a function named_cell(i,j,name), and cell_by_name so that a cell can be retrieved by its name
    (internally, only the position is stored, it will be easier)
*** DONE story_event(:toto, Walkable) changes the special cell with a new cell, created from a base class, and it is given the content of what happens on walk

     special_cell(:toto, Walkable) do
       foo bar baz
     end
