v0.2.0 - 2008/09/14

 - Convention over configuration (level / puzzle naming)
 - Easier to define boots, cells, tools, story, etc... with metaprogramming
 - Notification system
 - Quote system
 - Began documentation
 - Created a nice demo

v0.1.0 - 2008/08/24

 - Initial version that I can show to the world without feeling too
    shamefull.

 - Sort-of working puzzle system, plugin system, the editor can
    open adventure files, and you can edit individual levels. Some
    plugins are even started ! Definitely a lot to do...
