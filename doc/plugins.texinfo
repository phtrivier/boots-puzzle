@section Creating a plugin

A plugin is a way to extend an adventure by
@itemize
@item
creating new kinds of cells (that look or behave differently)
@item
creating new kinds of boots (that make you move differently)
@item
patching the code from any class in the game, to change its behavior
@end itemize

It is not advised to change things that happen in the game, but rather
to add new things.  Also, the plugin system is pretty crude, in the
sense that it probably does not handle very well several plugins
concurrently trying to modify the same things. 

To create a plugin, you should create a folder with the name of the plugin in the @file{plugins} subfolder of your adventure. 
For example, to add a plugin ``hello'' to our ``demo'' adventure, you would add a folder @file{adventures/demo/plugins/hello}.

Then, you need to describe the plugin, basically by giving its name, and telling the game whether this plugins depends on 
some other plugin. You do this by adding a @file{manifest.rb} file in the @file{plugins/hello} folder. The file should look like this : 

@example
Plugins.manifest("hello", ["events"])
@end example

This means that you are declaring a plugin called ``hello'', and it depends on one plugin, which is called ``events''. 
If you need to depend on several plugins, the file would look like this : 

@example
Plugins.manifest("hello", ["events", "water"])
@end example

If you don't depend on any plugin, you can simplify things : 

@example
Plugins.manifest("hello")
@end example
